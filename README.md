- Problems to solve:
  - design and html elements:
    - one container/card that holds the entire app
      - header element
        - one hero image with a paddle
        - an h1 "Ping Pong Score Keeper"
    - a section:
      - one div or paragraph that displays the current scores for player 1 and player 2: "0 to 0"
      - paragraph with: "Use the buttons below to keep score."
      - one select element with one input label "Playing to" and an expandable option element (5-11)
      - 3 buttons: "+1 Player One", "+1 Player Two", "Reset"
  - basic functionality:
    - a 2 player game
    - each player has a button to add points
    - an expandable option/select element to select what you want to play up to (5-11)
    - a display of the current scores/points for each player
    - A game is won by being the first player to win 11 points, and be at least 2 points ahead of his or her opponent.
    - when a player wins
      - display should change the loosers' score to red and the winners score to green
      - disable the buttons to add points
    - a reset button to reset the score
    - Optional features:
      - input fields to enter and display the player names
      - a button to undo points, if entered by accident or wrong
